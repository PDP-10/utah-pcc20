For simple things it is just as good as the clink PCL procedure, but it
has these restrictions:
1. No filenames.REL longer than 6 chars in first part.
2. No directory names in brackets allowed, must use logical names. 
3. Max of 6 .rel files.

To use it after compiling:
@MIC PCC:CLINK file1,file2,....

Note: file specs must NOT include the .REL suffix.
      The .exe file is saved as dsk:file1.EXE.
