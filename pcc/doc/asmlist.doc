Pcc:Asmlist.Exe is a little hack which will merge the MACRO output of
the compiler with the original C source file, and write the result to
the standard output.

SYNOPSIS
asmlist macro-file

The default extensions for "macro-file" are .MAC-USERNAME and .MAC in
that order; the extension need not be specified.


RESTRICTIONS
If you didn't specify the absolute pathname of the C file when you compiled it
(i.e. without a directory or logical-device), you must be connected to its
directory when you run asmlist.

BUGS
If the C file included other files which resulted in actual code generation
(an unusual occurrence, in practise), things screw up.

The output should be legal input to the assembler; it's very close.
