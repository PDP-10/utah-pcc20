**** As of 1/9/81, profiling no longer supported  ****

FYI, new development:
A few days ago I finished a preliminary 'profiling' version: instead of
using pc sampling (which is better) I use special versions of csv and cret.
All you have to do is re-link a program, including pcc:prolib.
It puts out a mon.out file which can be sorted in various ways with
pcc:psort:
      pcc:psort	[-c cpu time (default),
		 -w wall clk time,
		 -i invocations (calls),
		 -f fxn name		]	[file (mon.out default)].

It's got some lossages, e.g. the times for a caller include
it's callee's times, timing is kind of inaccurate right now, and the
printf's and putc's that happen when the mon.out file gets dumped are
included.  But it's a start.

I see little trouble with doing it the right way via a superior process
sampling the pc, and will do it soon.  I'd like to do it in a way
such that non-pcc pgms can be profiled, too.

The profile versions of things start with "P-" in <lepreau.io>....
